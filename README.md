Josh's Java Game Environment

Grab the files either from the "download zip" button in the lower right,
or if you have git installed on your machine, in a terminal write

```git clone https://github.com/UWFAI/Josh```

Assuming you have java installed on your machine, the fastest way is to compile 
from the command line. "cd" into the "Josh" directory and write

```javac *.java && java Controller```
